         SPRING CONTAINER :
IoC Container is tasked with the responsibility of connecting beans together to build a working application and it does so by reading
   a configuration provided by developer.
IoC container is external authority that passes a dependency to a dependent object that will use.
Having an external responsible for injecting dependencies allows very loosely coupled applications to built.

Spring beans are created from POJOs.

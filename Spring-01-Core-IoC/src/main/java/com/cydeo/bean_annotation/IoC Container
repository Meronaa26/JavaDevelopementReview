IoC Container : Defining beans
You are working for a Consulting Company as a Developer
Your company just received a project from Cydeo
Cydeo wants you to create an application that will create an account for
their full time and part time mentors
Client wants to switch between accounts easily in the same functionality


IoC is a principle that we do not leave the app control the execution by its own code
and use dependencies. Instead, we allow the framework to control the app and its
code.

Advantages :
Decoupling the execution of a task from its implementation
Making it easier to switch between different implementation
Great ease in testing a program by isolating a component or mocking it
dependencies



There are multiple ways to add beans in the Spring context
Using the @Bean annotation
Using stereotype annotations
